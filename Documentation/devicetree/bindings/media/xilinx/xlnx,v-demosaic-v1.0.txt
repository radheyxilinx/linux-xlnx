Xilinx HLS Video Demosaic IP
------------------------------------------------
The Xilinx HLS Video Demosaic IP is used to interface to a Bayer source.
It can convert 8-bit Bayer formats to 24 bit RGB format. Currently, the 
driver supports only the following configurations :
	- 8 bit, High Quality Interpolation
	- No zipper
All other configurations are not supported. Has been tested with kernel 4.6
and 1PPC designs.

The driver does not look at individual GPIO resets from the device tree.
It will be updated in a future update to this driver.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "xlnx,v-demosaic-v1.0".

- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device.

- clocks: Reference to the video core clock.
 
- ports: Video ports, using the DT bindings defined in ../video-interfaces.txt.
  The scaler has an input port (0) and an output port (1).


Required port properties:

- xlnx,video-format: Must be one of RBG, YUV_422, YUV_422 or YUV_420 for
  both input port (0) and output port (1).

- xlnx,video-width: Video width as defined in video.txt


Example :

demosaic_1: demosaic@0xA00B0000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,v-demosaic-v1.0";
		reg = <0x0 0xa00b0000 0x0 0x10000>;
		clocks = <&vid_stream_clk>;
		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				xlnx,video-format = <XVIP_VF_MONO_SENSOR>;
				xlnx,video-width = <8>;
				
				demosaic_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&tpg_out>;
				};
			};

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				xlnx,video-format = <XVIP_VF_RBG>;
				xlnx,video-width = <8>;

				demosaic_out: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&gamma_in>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
