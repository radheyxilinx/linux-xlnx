Xilinx VPHY (Staging)

The Xilinx Video PHY is a high-level video-specific wrapper around
different versions of the GT PHY. Its driver is phy/phy-xilinx-vphy.c

It offers the PHY driver interface as well as higher-level video
specific support functions.

Its current users are Xilinx HDMI RX/TX SS.
(See xlnx,v-hdmi-rx-ss.txt and xlnx,v-hdmi-tx-ss.txt)

At least one lane reference must be made (by each of HDMI RX and TX) to
get a handle to the vphy driver. The (currently 4) arguments are not
used and subject to change or removal. The vphy reference is subject to
change.

An example is, with comments for work-in-progress (TODO):

	vphy: vphy@a0000000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,vphy-1.1";
		reg = <0x0 0xa0000000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <0 92 4>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;

		clocks = <&vid_s_axi_clk>;
		clock-names = "axi-lite";

		/* these are created by the device tree generator */
		/* these are required and handled in the driver */
		xlnx,input-pixels-per-clock = <0x2>;
		xlnx,nidru = <0x1>;
		xlnx,nidru-refclk-sel = <0x4>;

		/* @TODO these are NOT yet created by the device tree generator */
